121,10,Tree species,Species name of the tree the sample came from.
122,10,Tree rings,Number of tree rings inferred as years.
123,10,Earlywood/Latewood,A notation on whether the outermost part of the tree grew early in the growing season or late in the growing season.
124,10,Number of analysed radii.,Number of radius analysed.
125,10,EW/LW measurements,Record of whether the earlywood and latewood of each ring has been measured separately.
126,10,Sapwood (Sp),Number of sapwood rings in a sample.
127,10,Bark (B),Whether bark was present in the sample. 
128,10,Waney edge (W),The outermost ring immediately inside the bark. Presence of this represents the last year of growth and the exact felling year.
129,10,Pith (P),The innermost ring of a tree stem or twig.
130,10,Tree age ≥,The minimum estimated age of the tree.
131,10,Tree age ≤,The maximum estimated age of the tree.
132,10,Inferred growth year ≥,The minimum estimated growth year as inferred from the analysed tree rings.
133,10,Inferred growth year ≤,The maximal estimated growth year as inferred from the analysed tree rings.
134,10,Estimated felling year,The felling year as inferred from the analysed outermost tree-ring date
135,10,Possible estimated felling year,Used for samples where dating has not been succesful but a non-statistically satisfactory dating suggestion is given.
136,10,Provenance,"The provenance of the sampled tree, inferred by comparing the sample with others. "
137,10,Outermost tree-ring date,The date of the outermost tree-ring
138,10,Not dated,"Used to mark samples as not having been succesfully dated, i. e. analysed but not dated"
139,10,Date note,Notes on  a sample not dated
140,10,Provenance comment,Comments on the provenance of a sample
141,10,Non-measured tree rings,Estimated number of non measured tree rings outside the outermost measured tree ring.
142,10,Non-measured sapwood rings,Estimated number of non-measured sapwood rings outside the outermost measured tree ring.
