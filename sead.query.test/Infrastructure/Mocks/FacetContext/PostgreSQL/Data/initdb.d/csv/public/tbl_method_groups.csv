method_group_id,description,group_name
1,Analysis methods based on the use of (sub)fossil biological organisms or their remains.,Palaeobiological
2,Analysis methods based on the use of the chemical or physical properties of materials or sediments.,Palaeo chemical/physical
3,"Methods used to determine the age of remains or sediments based on the decay of radioactive isotopes. Ages are usually established by comparing the observed level of the isotope in the artefact/sediment with the expected level for a zero age object. E.g. radiocarbon dating, uranium-series Th230/U234, lead 210. This group also for theoretically similar methods which compare observed energy with expected values, such as luminescence dating.",Dating by radiometric methods
4,Analysis methods which look at living or recently living biological organisms.,Modern biological
9,Composite or ambiguous methods which cannot be classified entirely as one or the other.,Biological/Chemical/Physical
13,Methods used to extract sediments either from in situ deposits or as subsamples of existing samples.,Sampling
14,"Methods for the measurement of (sample) dimensions, such as length and weight.",Size measurement
15,Methods for defining or describing colours. Includes quantitative and qualitative methods.,Colour
16,"Sample preparation method. Method used to extract identifiable elements/specimens/analysed sample from the physical sample (e.g. paraffin floatation, centrifugation).
In some parts of the database multiple preparation methods may be given for a sample, as separate entries (e.g. 1. HF treatment; 2. centrifugation; 3. Slide preparation)",Preparation method
17,"Methods for spatial location of objects, samples or sites in 2 or 3 dimensional space. Includes both geographical (Worldwide) and local (e.g. site) or regional coordinate systems and altitude or vertical displacement.",Coordinate and altitude systems
18,Methods for classification of soil horizons,Soil horizons
19,Methods used to determing the age of a material to a chronological or cultural period.,Dating to period
20,"Methods capable of allocating a calendar, or absolute age to a material. E.g. varve counting, dendrochronology, historical records. Dates may also include a range of possible years or termini (i.e. oldest/youngest possible).",Dating to calendar year(s)
21,"Dating methods not assignable to calendar, radiometric or period based. Includes methods based on geological properties other than stratigraphic correlation (e.g. palaeomagnetism, weathering), curve matching (e.g. wiggle matching of 14C dates) or less common methods such as fission tracking or hydration.",Dating by other method
22,"Dating methods which rely on the accumulation of energy in the material to be dated post genesis, heating or deposition.",Dating by radiation exposure methods
