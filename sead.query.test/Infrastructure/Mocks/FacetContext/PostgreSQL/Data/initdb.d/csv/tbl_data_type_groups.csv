data_type_group_id,data_type_group_name,description
4,Presence only,"Only the existence of taxa/variables in a sample is recorded, as a '1', with no quantity being given. Absence is implicit."
2,Discrete,"Systems based on distinct and separate integer values (1,2,3...) from a numerical sequence. This is the standard group for biological proxy counts."
1,Continuous,Systems based on the assumption that data can assume any numerical value.
3,Classification,"Any systems based on the division of, or estimation of, quantities into predefined categories, either numerical or relative (e.g. 1-10, few, many). In statistical terms, this group covers ordinal, nominal and categorical data types."
7,Composite scale,Any system which combines two or more forms of counting. E.g. a discrete abundance for small counts and an approximation for super abundant taxa
5,Relative scale,"A loose form of classification, where the scale indicates the relative amounts of taxa/variables (1,2,3, many). To be avoided if possible."
8,Chronological,"Data which indicate the age of sample, either in relation to an event, decay based curve or counted scale."
19,Geographical,Geographical data either as a value or as a string.
