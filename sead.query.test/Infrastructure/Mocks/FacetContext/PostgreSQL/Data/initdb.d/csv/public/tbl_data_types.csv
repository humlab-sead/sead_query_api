data_type_id,data_type_group_id,data_type_name,definition
5,2,Abundance,"The absolute number of the counted element (e.g. seeds, fossils) present in the sample."
6,4,Presence,"The element/fossil is present in the sample, but not quantified (numerical classification where 1 = presence)"
7,5,Spot test interpretation,"The relative intensity of a spot test result on a three grade scale: 1, 2, 3 where 3 is the highest."
8,1,Continuous,A measured quantity.
9,2,MNI,Minimum Number of Individual organisms as calculated from recorded parts (e.g. whole insect equivalents)
10,7,Partial abundance,"A legacy data type used in BugsCEP to represent partially quantified and incomplete lists, e.g. quantified up to 50 individuals and then estimated."
13,7,Undefined other,"Data type is not clearly defined, could be a combination of quantification, presence/absence and semi-quantification or qualification. Beware of using data of this type for quantification."
14,8,Uncalibrated dates,Sample ages in uncalibrated values consisting of mean and error (+/-). Requires calibration to compare with calendar years.
15,8,Counted dates,"Sample ages derived from counted rings, layers or dated events."
16,8,Calendar dates,sample ages calibrated to calendar dates
18,7,Categorical & Scaled (0-5,"Mix of data specified on a scale of 0 to 5 where 0 is absence and 5 is maximum amount of property, and data classified on the presence of a property (e.g. Granite = tempering by granite present)"
19,3,Categorical,Data classified according to a set of predefined categories (e.g. temperature classes; tempering material classes)
20,5,Percentage,Data expressed as a percentage (i.e. out x of 100)
43,19,Estimated Years,Dates that are an estimation
44,19,Composite date,"A date which may include other information than the age, such as season, terminus and/or error margin."
45,19,Approximate location,"Geographical location given as approximate values or text. May include multiple levels, text strings and exclusions (e.g. not Poland)."
46,1,Mixed-method dependent,Multiple datatypes from one method. (e.g. multiple isotope types from masspectrometry)
