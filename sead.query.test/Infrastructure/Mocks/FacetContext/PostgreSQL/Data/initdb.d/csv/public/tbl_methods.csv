3,,"Primarily fossil insect analyses, although other similar groups are usually included.
The method is commonly used for the reconstruction of natural and human environments in archaeological and palaeoecological contexts as well as climate change studies through the Mutual Climatic Range (MCR) method. 
Standard method: 
- samples disaggregated in warm water over a 300µm sieve; 
- excess water removed from sieved residue, then residue mixed with small amount of liquid paraffin (kerosene); 
- cold water added and left to stand for 15 minutes after which the floating (paraffin captured) fraction is pored into a 300µm sieve; 
- latter stage (fill, float, pour) repeated three times; paraffin washed out with detergent and warm water; 
- float is then stored and examined under a binocular microscope usually under 96% alcohol;
- insect remains and other interesting finds are picked out and identified through the use of reference collections and identification keys.
NOTE: storage in alcohol most likely has a detrimental effect on the possibility for using insect remains for C14 dating! Any samples where insect remains are to be dated should therefore be only stored in distilled water.",Fossil insects,1,Palaeoentomology,1,

Standard method and variations:
- samples are disaggregated in warm water and washed through a sieve (mesh size varies with application, most commonly 250 or 500µm);
- material caught in the sieve is then either dried or stored in water/alcohol before sorting under a binocular microscope;
- specimens are identified with the help of reference collections and identification keys. ",Plant macros,1,Plant macrofossil analyses,2,
