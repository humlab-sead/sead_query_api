20,3790,"Body elongate and parallel-sided.  Head large and elongate, about as long and as wide as the thorax, towards the rear mostly widened.  The frontal process short and blunt or broadly truncated, much more weakly developed than in the related genera.  Eyes flat, much shorter than the arched, unmargined temples.  The middle frontal furrows are short, those originating from the inner margin of the eyes, lateral to the frontal furrows, oblique to the middle of the head and commonly effaced.  The basal segments of the antennae are long, shaft-like, about as long as the 4 following segments; terminal segment of maxillary palps pointed, much narrower and shorter than the previous one.  Outer side of the mandibles in the basal half with a strong elongate furrow.  Thorax with two long rows of somewhat irregularly placed punctures. Its side margins towards the anterior angles well developed, only about in the middle of the underside downwardly curved.  Aedeagus without or with 2 very short parameres.
Without examination of the genitalia, a realistic identification is impossible, for most species.
Xantholinus species prefer to live in compost, under rotting plant-materials in manure and in dung, often also under leaves and moss or in the rotting wood of hollow trees.
	The subgenera based on the genital-structure are mentioned here, merely within the framework of the key, as they do not always permit identification according to external characteristics.

42,3790,"A KEY TO THE SPECIES OF QUEDIUS  STEPH.
(translated from the German by Mark Walker (revised P C Buckland) from Freude, Harde & Lohse, (1964), Die Kafer Mitteleuropas, 4, 205 - 219).

 Head oval to transversely rounded. Maxillary palps with well developed terminal segments. Eyes usually large, often occupying whole side of the head.  Pronotum strongly convex, usually more strongly narrowed towards the front, ""bowl shaped"". In lateral view the epipleura of the pronotum are not evident, so that the front and outside of the anterior pronotum are widely extended and the epipleura are thereby positioned nearer to the inner side of the pronotum. The elytra are almost always densely punctured and pubescent (except s.g. Quedionuchus), the abdomen is either parallel-sided or acuminate. The males have strongly dilated front tarsi and a notch on the hind margin of the 6th abdominal sternite, often also a more strongly developed head.

For the determination of species, the position of setae-bearing punctures on the head and pronotum is important. On the inner margin of the eyes one always finds an anterior and posterior forehead puncture; the posterior one may be situated distant or close to the inner border of eyes. Between this puncture and the neck is found at least a further puncture or pair of punctures. In addition to all these punctures, in some species there may be more punctures. The pronotum has on the anterior half of the disc on each side a row of at most three punctures. Between the punctures and the side margin has a more or less irregular row of additional punctures. About the middle of the pronotum near the side margin is a conspicuous seta-bearing puncture, the so called marginal puncture.

Quedius species live in moss, in ground litter, under bark and many in nests or holes in trees.

145,2118,"Small black beetles sometimes with a slight greenish tinge and clothed with brownish to whitish recumbent pubescence. They occur in abundance on nettles, their foodplants. Length 1.5-2.5mm. Two species occur in the UK, and two further species occur in central Europe (i.e. fulvipes Erichson and velatus Wollaston). They both combine the heavily sculptured frons of glaber with the predominantly orange legs of urticae so would be immediately recognised as additions to the British fauna should either be found here.

The only British genus in the tribe Polydrusus is very like Phyllobius, its members differing mainly in the form of the antennal scrobes and generally rather lighter build.  Some species are covered in metallic green scales, the remainder greyish, brownish or metallic coppery colour.  Parthenogenesis occurs in certain species (e.g. P. mollis ) L.3.5- 9.5mm.

Eyes large, round-oval, more-or-less strongly protuberant and extending over lower cheeks. Pronotal vestiture usually gathering together to form four transverse brushes or crests. Metasternum as long as or longer than the second sternite, Scutellum distinct. Elytra with punctate striae. Upper side hairy and often with patches of pale hair-scales.  This extensive genus appears as a repository for those family members which are not easily placed in other genera and is hence doubtless polyphyletic. In some species these is a marked sexual dimorphism, the males always, the females sometimes, with distinct elytral humeral angles (shoulders). This necessitates separate keys for the sexes, so it cannot be based on subgenera. A few species are probably native to Britain, occurring in old trees, nests of birds, mammals and bees. Several synanthropic species may occur together so it cannot be automatically assumed that females belong to the most easily identifiable males. The earlier grouping according to the fourth tarsal joint being lobed or not is difficult and sometimes dubious to ascertain, so other, more reliable characters are used in the key to species. NB. Need to see EMM 1958; 236

Key to subgenera

This may help provide a cross-check for specimens identified by using more artificial characters, or to point to further species not yet recorded from Britain. Being predominantly synanthropic insects spread by commerce, further additions to our list can be expected. 12 species are currently recognised as British, whilst 25 are included for central Europe in Freude (1967).

AGRIOTINAE

These are all humicolous species. Chiefly recognisable by the absence of a frontal carina, the curvature of frons into the clypeus and labrum being largely continuous in lateral view. The three west European genera all occur in Britain and include some of our most ubiquitous elaterids.

Key to Genera

2.  Front and mid femora reddish, sometimes darker basally; apical third of elytra at most very obscurely yellowish
                                                                                                                                                ..........rufipes

Elytral striae as in biguttatus but elytral apex not yellow and femora red. Apex of aedeagus almost spatulate with preapical curved prominence.

 -  Front and mid femora bronze-black; apical third of elytra yellowish.

3.  Interstice 4 with two discal pores and obviously wider than 3 and 5; elytra strongly depressed and margins almost right-angled after stria 7.
                                                                                                                             ..............quadripunctatus

The only species having interstice 4 much wider than 3 or 5; specimens are known with an extra discal pore on one side(ie.therefore 3 on one side, 2 on other),but none have been found with one of the pores missing.

 -  Interstice 4 with one discal pore and not or scarcely wider than 3 and 5; elytra less depressed, stria 7 on the downward curve to the elytral margin.
                                                                                                                                                 ................4

The broadly yellow elytral apex, relative widths of the elytral interstices mentioned in the key and the single discal pore on interstice 4 should serve to distinguish this species from others. Occasionally an extra (second) discal pore may be present on one side and such individuals could be mistaken for abnormal quadripunctatus, but for the comparative width of interstice 4 in relation to 3 and 5.

 -  Striae very finely punctured; interstices 3 to 6 flat,dull and very strongly alutaceous.	
                                                                                                                                     ..............substriatus

-  Head with frontal grooves convergent behind, temples more strongly punctured leaving vertex only narrowly impunctate in middle; elytral interstices shining, never alutaceous; striae more strongly punctured.
                                                                                                                                            .............palustris

A variable species extremely close to hypocrita, but separable mainly by characters given in key. Melanistic forms with very dark red tibiae can be confused with aestuans, which like hypocrita and palustris has two apical elytral pores, one in aquaticus.

A rather large (5-5.5mm), very dark species with bronze-black tibiae and only one apical elytral pore, the only British species having only the one pore at the apex of each elytron. 

 -  Elytra with two apical pores.
                                                                                                                                          ...........aesthuans

Very like aquaticus, but rather smaller (4.5-5mm) and elytra with two preapical pores on each side. Legs entirely black end elytral striae usually at least slightly evanescent towards apex (usually strongly in aquaticus). A variable species, some individuals of which have been referred to as the doubtful species strigifrons Baudi. Aedeagus much smaller than in other British Notiophilus.",28951
339,2118,"A large genus of mostly black beetles characterised by the spinose dorsal surface of their front legs. The arrangement of these spines is of value in identification, though within any species there will be a degree of variation; the general pattern however is of value. There are three main forms- a) an almost uniform size throughout the series showing at most a gradual increase in size to the tibial apex (i.e. atratus), b) spines in apical half much larger than the basal half (i.e. solidus, brevis), c) similar to b but with a group of smaller spines interrupting the larger ones in the apical half (i.e.. obscurus). M.exilis is unique in being like those in group c but having an isolated strong tooth in the finely serrate series in the basal half. In solidus and brevis the tarsal claws have a very strong basal tooth; in the other species the claw is at most slightly dilated towards the base.

Meligethes feed on pollen and whilst most probably occur on a wide range of flowers, several at least apparently breed only on a very limited number of plant species. 36 species have been recorded from Britain, but many more occur in central and western Europe.

415,2118,"Genus Acrotrichis

This is a large genus of closely similar species distinguishable only on genitalic features and hence requiring dissection and examination by the specialist. Several species occur commonly in old cow dung. The very broad form and sinuate (i.e. wavy) hind margin of the pronotum are characteristic features of this genus, precluding their confusion with any other dung-frequenting beetles. L. 0.65-1.2mm.

20.  Aedeagus right angled apically.  Spermatheca with twistings quite or almost touching base of mushroom shaped piece. Slightly larger more parallel sided species with pronotum less shiny, frequently densely punctulate and reticulate. Sometimes confused with fascicularis, parva and sericans; differs from former in smaller size, slightly weaker basal arch, and sides of pronotum being parallel for a short distance forwards from base (in fascicularis broadest at base evenly narrowing forwards). From parva most consistently distinguished by the at most very weakly puncturated head. A. sericans is slightly smaller and has more slender antennae. 
                                                                                                                                         ........... norvegica

 -  Aedeagus truncate apically. Spermatheca with twistings more remote from mushroom shaped part. Slightly smaller species, often tapering behind, with pronotum very shiny at most with scattered, rather coarse punctures. The brightly shining pronotum strongly suggests atomaria and lucidula, but differing from both by the larger eyes, more depressed form, more evenly rounded pronotal side margins and absence of basal arch. 
                                                                                                                                          .......... thoracica

 -  Pronotum rather narrower, weakly convex, more densely puncturate. Antennae usually lighter. Spermatheca. Best separated from other species (has been confused with intermedia, strandi, rugulosa, norvegica and suecica) by the form of the spermatheca, which can only be confused with that of strandi. 
                                                                                                                                  ………….fascicularis

25.  Pronotum less rounded at sides with denser, coarser puncturation. Antennal segments 1 and 2 dark. Spermatheca. Closest to fratercula, having very glossy pronotum and strong basal arch, but narrower and slightly smaller with basal antennal joints much darker. Pronotum more evenly tapering anteriorly, scutellum and elytra more diffusely and more coarsely puncturate.
                                                                                                      .............(see couplet 17)........ (sjöbergi)

                                                                                     .......... (see couplet 15)........ (henrici (=fratercula))

26.  Pronotum coarsely puncturate, not broader than elytra, these not narrowing behind. Spermatheca. Closest to fascicularis and silvatica, differing from former in slightly smaller size, more glossy, more diffusely but more coarsely puncturate Pronotum and shorter median antennal joints. From silvatica, which it resembles in size and shape, by rather more diffusely, but much more coarsely puncturate pronotum and paler antennae. The spermatheca is very like that of rugulosa but the two species differ more on external features, the present one being smaller, having a shinier head with weaker and more diffuse puncturation, a shinier and more diffusely puncturated pronotum and paler antennae with shorter median joints. 
                                                                                                                                             .......... suecica

27.  Pronotum distinctly, often strongly, reticulate, hardly more glossy than elytra. Larger, broader species with spermatheca as in  . Closest to fratercula, lucidula and atomaria; most easily distinguished from the first named by the much smaller eyes (in present species). Larger than lucidula and atomaria and with more strongly reticulate microsculpture on the pronotum.
                                                                                                                                               ............ danica
